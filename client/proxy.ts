// Thatâ€™s a tooling workaround: This file appears to be a module (where global
// `this` is `undefined` and often compiled to a literal `undefined`). But it
// is actually used as a script in the end. Since we do a string replacement on
// this file anyway for `%TARGET_NAME%`, this was an easy solution for `this` too.

Certain parts of \`window.Elm\` aren't available yet! That's fine though!

\`elm-watch\` has generated a stub file in place of Elm's compiled JS. This is
because until just now, there was no need to spend time on generating JS!

This stub file is now connecting to \`elm-watch\` via WebSocket, letting it know
that it's time to start generating real JS. Once that's done the page should be
automatically reloaded. But if you get compilation errors you'll need to fix
them first.
