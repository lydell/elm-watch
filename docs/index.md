# elm-watch

> `elm make` in watch mode. Fast and reliable.

elm-watch recompiles whenever your Elm files change and reloads the compiled JS in the browser.

- 👉 [Getting started](./getting-started)
- 👉 [What elm-watch is](./what-elm-watch-is)

Note that elm-watch is all about Elm. Not HTML, not CSS, not JavaScript, not TypeScript. That’s a strength in my opinion, but also something to be aware of. You can’t just replace for example Parcel with elm-watch and expect everything to be taken care of.
