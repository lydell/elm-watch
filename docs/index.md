# elm-watch

> `elm make` in watch mode. Fast and reliable.

elm-watch recompiles whenever your Elm files change and reloads the compiled JS in the browser.

Note that elm-watch is all about Elm. Not HTML, not CSS, not JavaScript, not TypeScript and not serving files or proxying requests. Thatâ€™s a strength in my opinion, but also something to be aware of. You canâ€™t just replace for example Parcel with elm-watch and expect everything to be taken care of.
