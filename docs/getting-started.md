## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev elm-watch
```

{: .info }  
‚ÑπÔ∏è You need to install Elm itself separately, in whatever way you prefer ([installer][elm-guide-install], [npm][elm-npm-package], [elm-tooling]).

{: .info }  
‚ÑπÔ∏è Node.js 14 or newer is required. On Windows, only Node.js 16 or later is officially supported.

```
npx elm-watch --help
```

## Quick start

> üìΩ [Video showing how to get started][getting-started-with-elm-watch]

Create a file called [elm-watch.json](../elm-watch.json/):

```
npx elm-watch init
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```json
{
    "targets": {
        "My target name": {
            "inputs": [
                "src/Main.elm"
            ],
            "output": "build/main.js"
        }
    }
}
```

Start watching with hot reloading:

```
npx elm-watch hot
```

To build for production:

```
npx elm-watch make --optimize
```

That‚Äôs pretty much it! For the remaining details:

```
npx elm-watch --help
```

## Your responsibilities

elm-watch is only responsible for turning your Elm files into JS files. Like running `elm make src/Main.elm --output build/main.js` yourself. So that‚Äôs the mindset you need to have.

**You are responsible for** creating an HTML file, link to the built JS and serve files.

- If you‚Äôre just getting started, you can create an HTML file with a relative link to the built JS and double-click it to open it in a browser.

  ```html
  <!-- Relative URL to the built JS. -->
  <script src="./build/main.js"></script>
  ```

  üëâ [Minimal example](https://github.com/lydell/elm-watch/tree/main/example-minimal#readme)

- ‚Ä¶except if you use `Browser.application`. It doesn‚Äôt work on the `file://` protocol. There are plenty of quick little ‚Äúplease serve this directory on localhost‚Äù tools, though.

  ```html
  <!-- Absolute URL to the built JS. -->
  <script src="/build/main.js"></script>
  ```

  üëâ [Example CLI server tool](https://github.com/vercel/serve)

- If you need TypeScript and CSS compilation, you need to set up another build tool alongside elm-watch.

  ```html
  <!-- Separate script tag for Elm. -->
  <script src="/build/main.js"></script>
  <!-- Another script tag for JS built by another tool. -->
  <script src="/build/bundle.js"></script>
  ```
