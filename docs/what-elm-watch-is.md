# What elm-watch _is_

Remember the first time you ran `elm make`? Itâ€™s super fast, and has beautiful output. And itâ€™s really stable! If the majority of your code is Elm, why complicate things with extra layers where things can go wrong? elm-watch tries to stay as close as that ideal as possible.

- **Maximum speed.** elm-watch tries to do as little as possible besides running `elm make` for you. Doing less work is always faster!
- [**Hot reloading.**](../hot-reloading/) elm-watch tries to reimagine the level of quality of hot reloading. The goal is to never leave you wondering if it worked at all.
- **Beautiful colors.** Elmâ€™s error messages are lovely and colorful. elm-watch takes care to preserve them.
- [**Browser UI.**](../browser-ui/) elm-watch always shows you the latest status in the browser. Switching to `--debug` mode â€“ or even `--optimize` mode â€“ is only a click away.
- **Cache free.** Elm already has a cache â€“ the `elm-stuff/` folder â€“ which is really stable and all you need. Famously one of the hardest things in programming, elm-watch has no extra caching to worry about.
- **Elm centric.** elm-watch puts Elm at the heart. Letâ€™s take advantage of Elmâ€™s unique capabilities, like `elm make --output /dev/null` for super fast type checking of apps youâ€™re not currently focusing on!
- [**Reasonably hackable.**](../postprocess/) Ever wanted to adjust Elmâ€™s compiled JS? Thatâ€™s just a `String -> String` function away for both development and production builds.
- **Well tested.** elm-watch has 100 % test coverage, save for a few ignore coverage comments. elm-watch is serious about stability.
- **Super scalable.** elm-watch can handle many Elm apps without getting slow. Only the apps you work on get compiled â€“ in most recently used order. The rest are only type checked, which is faster.

## Ideas for the future

- **Interactive errors.** Filter by target or Elm file. Collapse long code snippets (`case` expressions).
- **Debug redux.** Apart from the standard `--debug` mode, also offer the [Redux DevTools] just one click away. Like [elm-monitor] and [elm-remotedev] but with no extra setup.
- **Stand-alone binary.** While Iâ€™ve kept the npm dependencies for elm-watch to a bare minimum, it would be nice with a lean, super resource efficient, stand-alone binary. Most of elm-watchâ€™s tests are written at a very high level, so they should be reusable with an implementation written in any language with too much work. Iâ€™ve been thinking about writing it in Rust, or forking the Elm compiler and building the watcher straight into it (while making no other changes) â€“ which would unlock even more potential, since I can access internals.
